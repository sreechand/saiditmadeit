# Cell Highlighting Implementation

## Overview

The cell highlighting system has been successfully implemented for the Snake Word Game. This feature provides visual feedback when players complete words by highlighting the cells with appropriate colors.

## Implementation Details

### Requirements Implemented

✅ **Initial State**: All cells start with white background and black text  
✅ **Target Word Completion**: Cells are highlighted with light green background when a valid (target) word is completed  
✅ **Distractor Word Completion**: Cells are highlighted with light red background when an invalid (distractor) word is completed  
✅ **Persistent Highlighting**: Highlighting persists throughout the game session until reset  

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Updated GameBoard Component (`src/client/components/GameBoard.tsx`)

- **Word Status Mapping**: Created logic to map completed words to their cell positions
- **Cell Highlighting Logic**: Implemented layered styling system:
  - Base layer: All cells start with white background (`bg-white text-black`)
  - Word completion layer: Light green (`bg-green-200`) for target words, light red (`bg-red-200`) for distractor words
  - Snake layer: Snake segments override word highlighting when present
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Snake segments take priority over word highlighting for visual clarity

#### 2. Enhanced Game State Management (`src/client/hooks/useGameState.ts`)

- **Word Collection Tracking**: Updated `COMPLETE_WORD` action to properly mark words as collected
- **State Persistence**: Ensured word completion status persists in both target and distractor word lists
- **Separate Variable Names**: Fixed variable naming conflicts in reducer actions

#### 3. Improved Snake Logic (`src/client/hooks/useSnake.ts`)

- **Word Completion Detection**: Enhanced `checkAndUpdateWords` function to properly detect when all letters of a word are covered by the snake
- **State Updates**: Added proper dispatching of word completion events
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript issues with undefined checks

### Visual Behavior

1. **Game Start**: All 36 cells (6×6 grid) display with white background and black letters
2. **Snake Movement**: Snake segments show with their respective colors (blue head, green/red body)
3. **Word Completion**: When snake covers all letters of a word:
   - Target words: All cells of that word get light green background
   - Distractor words: All cells of that word get light red background
4. **Layered Display**: Snake segments override word highlighting, so active snake positions show snake colors
5. **Persistence**: Word highlighting remains visible even after snake moves away from those cells

### Code Structure

```typescript
// Word status mapping in GameBoard
const wordStatusMap = new Map<string, 'valid' | 'invalid'>();
allWords.forEach(word => {
  if (word.isCollected) {
    const status = word.isTarget ? 'valid' : 'invalid';
    word.positions.forEach(pos => {
      wordStatusMap.set(`${pos.x},${pos.y}`, status);
    });
  }
});

// Cell styling with proper layering
if (wordStatus === 'valid') {
  cellClasses = cellClasses.replace('bg-white text-black', 'bg-green-200 text-black');
} else if (wordStatus === 'invalid') {
  cellClasses = cellClasses.replace('bg-white text-black', 'bg-red-200 text-black');
}

// Snake segments override word highlighting
if (isSnakeCell) {
  // Snake colors take priority
}
```

### Testing

The implementation has been verified to:
- ✅ Compile without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Build successfully for production
- ✅ Maintain existing game functionality
- ✅ Follow the established code patterns and architecture

### Integration

This feature integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing game state management
- Snake movement system
- Word collection logic
- Victory conditions
- Theme-based styling

The cell highlighting system is now ready for use and provides clear visual feedback to players about their progress in collecting target words while avoiding distractor words.
