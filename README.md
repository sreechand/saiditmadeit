## Snake Word Game

A revolutionary Snake-themed word puzzle game for Reddit's Devvit platform that combines classic snake mechanics with strategic word discovery gameplay. Players guide a snake through a 6√ó6 grid of letters to collect three hidden themed words while avoiding distractor words, creating an engaging blend of action and vocabulary skills.

### What Makes This Game Unique

üêç **Stop-and-Wait Innovation**: Unlike traditional snake games, the snake automatically stops at each letter cell, allowing players to strategically plan their next move and think about word formation. This creates a perfect balance between action and puzzle-solving.

üéØ **Intelligent Puzzle Generation**: Advanced algorithm creates solvable puzzles with proper word distribution across four orientations (horizontal left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top), ensuring every game is both challenging and fair.

üé® **Visual Word Formation**: Snake segments change color based on correctness - blue head with direction arrows, green segments for target word letters, red segments for mistakes, providing instant visual feedback on your progress.

üß© **Multi-Directional Word Placement**: Words can be placed in any of four orientations, creating complex puzzle layouts that require spatial thinking and strategic snake navigation.

üì± **Cross-Platform Controls**: Seamlessly supports keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys), touch controls with directional buttons, and swipe gestures for mobile devices.

üé≠ **Rich Theme System**: Five themed categories (Animals, Colors, Food, Sports, Nature) with 100+ carefully curated words, smart difficulty scaling, and conflict-avoidance algorithms to prevent player confusion.

üéÆ **Adaptive Difficulty**: Three difficulty levels that change both gameplay mechanics and visual hints - from word-visible easy mode to hint-free hard mode with faster snake speeds.

üèÜ **Comprehensive Scoring**: Dynamic scoring system with base points, word completion bonuses, time bonuses, and efficiency multipliers based on difficulty level.

## How to Play

### Game Objective
Find and collect all three hidden target words by guiding your snake through the letter grid. Target words share a common theme, while distractor words are designed to mislead you.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Starting the Game**
- Click the "üêç Start Playing" button on the splash screen
- The game begins with your snake (blue head with direction arrow) at position (0,0) in the top-left corner
- You'll see a 6√ó6 grid filled with letters in a responsive layout
- Three target words are hidden in the grid, along with 2+ distractor words
- The left sidebar shows your progress and theme information

#### 2. **Understanding the Interface**
- **Left Sidebar**: Word tracker showing target word progress, theme category, and game statistics
- **Center**: Interactive game board with 6√ó6 letter grid and animated snake overlay
- **Right Sidebar**: Game controls including movement buttons, pause/resume, settings, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Visual Feedback**: Snake head shows direction arrow, segments are color-coded by correctness

#### 3. **Moving Your Snake**
- **Desktop**: Use Arrow Keys or WASD to move up, down, left, right
- **Mobile**: Use touch controls (directional buttons) or swipe gestures in any direction
- **Auto-Stop**: Your snake automatically stops when it reaches any letter cell
- **Direction Indicator**: Snake head displays an arrow (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí) showing current movement direction

#### 4. **Collecting Letters**
- When stopped at a letter, the game automatically checks if it's the correct next letter for any target word
- **Correct Letter**: Snake grows with a green segment, you earn 10 points, word progress updates
- **Wrong Letter**: Snake grows with a red/gray segment, you lose 5 points, wrong letter counter increases
- **Letter Marking**: Collected letters are marked with yellow highlighting on the grid
- After processing the letter, press any movement key to continue

#### 5. **Word Formation Rules**
- Letters must be collected in sequence (first letter ‚Üí last letter in word direction)
- Words can be spelled in any of four orientations: horizontal (left-to-right, right-to-left) or vertical (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top)
- You can collect target words in any order
- **Target Words**: Give 50 point completion bonus and count toward victory
- **Distractor Words**: Give 25 point completion bonus but don't count toward victory

#### 6. **Winning the Game**
- Collect all three target words to win (distractor words are optional)
- **Victory Screen**: Shows the theme category, your final score, completion time, and detailed statistics
- **Final Score**: Based on correct letters (10 pts), word bonuses (50/25 pts), wrong letter penalties (-5 pts), and time bonus

#### 7. **Game Controls & Features**
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume the game (or use pause button)
- **R Key**: Reset the game (or use restart button)
- **Settings Button**: Change difficulty level and theme category
- **Movement**: Arrow Keys, WASD, touch controls, or swipe gestures
- **Real-time Stats**: Track snake length, correct/wrong segments, and word collection progress

### Difficulty Levels

#### Easy Mode (2 cells/second)
- Target words are visible on screen
