## Snake Word Game

A revolutionary Snake-themed word puzzle game for Reddit's Devvit platform that combines classic snake mechanics with strategic word discovery gameplay. Players guide a snake through a 6√ó6 grid of letters to collect three hidden themed words while avoiding distractor words, creating an engaging blend of action and vocabulary skills.

### What Makes This Game Unique

üêç **Stop-and-Wait Innovation**: Unlike traditional snake games, the snake automatically stops at each letter cell, allowing players to strategically plan their next move and think about word formation.

üéØ **Intelligent Puzzle Generation**: Advanced algorithm creates solvable puzzles with proper word distribution, ensuring every game is both challenging and fair.

üé® **Visual Word Formation**: Snake segments change color based on correctness - green/blue for target word letters, red/gray for mistakes, providing instant visual feedback.

üß© **Multi-Directional Word Placement**: Words can be placed horizontally or vertically in both directions (left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top), creating complex puzzle layouts.

üì± **Mobile-Optimized Controls**: Supports both keyboard (WASD/Arrow keys) and touch controls (swipe gestures) for seamless gameplay across devices.

## How to Play

### Game Objective
Find and collect all three hidden target words by guiding your snake through the letter grid. Target words share a common theme, while distractor words are designed to mislead you.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Starting the Game**
- The game begins with your snake (blue head) at position (0,0) in the top-left corner
- You'll see a 6√ó6 grid filled with letters
- Three target words are hidden in the grid, along with 2+ distractor words

#### 2. **Moving Your Snake**
- **Desktop**: Use Arrow Keys or WASD to move up, down, left, right
- **Mobile**: Swipe in the direction you want to move
- **Auto-Stop**: Your snake automatically stops when it reaches any letter

#### 3. **Collecting Letters**
- When stopped at a letter, the game checks if it's the correct next letter for any target word
- **Correct Letter**: Snake grows with a green/blue segment, you earn 10 points
- **Wrong Letter**: Snake grows with a red/gray segment, you lose 5 points
- After collecting a letter, press any movement key to continue

#### 4. **Word Formation Rules**
- Letters must be collected in sequence (first letter ‚Üí last letter)
- Words can be spelled in any direction the word is placed
- You can collect target words in any order
- Distractor words give fewer points and don't count toward victory

#### 5. **Winning the Game**
- Collect all three target words to win
- **Word Completion Bonus**: 50 points for target words, 25 for distractors
- **Victory Screen**: Shows the theme, your final score, and statistics

#### 6. **Game Controls**
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume the game
- **R Key**: Reset the game
- **Movement**: Arrow Keys, WASD, or swipe gestures

### Difficulty Levels

#### Easy Mode (2 cells/second)
- Target words are visible on screen
- Slower snake movement for careful planning
- Best for learning the game mechanics

#### Medium Mode (3 cells/second)
- Shows word blanks with letter counts (e.g., "_ _ _ _" for 4-letter word)
- Moderate snake speed
- Balanced challenge for regular players

#### Hard Mode (4 cells/second)
- No hints about target words
- Faster snake movement requires quick decisions
- Maximum challenge for experienced players

### Themed Categories

#### üêæ Animals
Target words like CAT, DOG, EAGLE, SHARK, WHALE, TIGER
Distractors from other categories to confuse players

#### üé® Colors  
Target words like RED, BLUE, VIOLET, CORAL, INDIGO
Mixed with non-color words as distractors

#### üçé Food
Target words like APPLE, PIZZA, HONEY, BEANS, GRAPE
Combined with non-food distractors

#### ‚öΩ Sports
Target words like SOCCER, TENNIS, RUGBY, DIVE, SWIM
Includes various athletic activities and sports terms

#### üå≤ Nature
Target words like TREE, OCEAN, FOREST, BEACH, RIVER
Natural world elements and landscapes

### Scoring System
- **Correct Letters**: 10 points each
- **Target Word Completion**: 50 point bonus
- **Distractor Word Completion**: 25 point bonus  
- **Wrong Letter Penalty**: -5 points each
- **Time Bonus**: Faster completion = higher final score

## Game Architecture

The Snake Word Game features a sophisticated architecture built with modern web technologies and advanced game design principles:

### Puzzle Generation System
- **Multi-Attempt Algorithm**: Tries up to 100 generation attempts to create optimal puzzles
- **Multi-Directional Placement**: Words placed horizontally (left-to-right, right-to-left) and vertically (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top)
- **Smart Collision Detection**: Prevents invalid overlaps while allowing strategic letter sharing
- **Pathfinding Validation**: Ensures all target words are reachable using A* pathfinding algorithms
- **Quality Scoring**: Rates puzzles based on word distribution, orientation variety, and accessibility
- **Fallback Generation**: Provides guaranteed-solvable simple puzzles if complex generation fails

### Game State Management Architecture
- **`useGameState`**: Central state management using React's useReducer pattern with comprehensive action types
- **`useSnake`**: Handles movement physics, collision detection, automatic stopping, and growth mechanics
- **`useWordCollection`**: Manages letter validation, sequential word formation, and scoring logic
- **`useGameController`**: Coordinates input handling (keyboard + touch), game flow, and event management
- **TypeScript Safety**: Strict typing across all components with shared interfaces and comprehensive error handling

### Theme Management System
- **Curated Word Database**: 100+ carefully selected words across 5 themed categories
- **Difficulty-Aware Filtering**: Dynamically selects words based on length and complexity for chosen difficulty
