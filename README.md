## Snake Word Game

A revolutionary Snake-themed word puzzle game for Reddit's Devvit platform that combines classic snake mechanics with strategic word discovery gameplay. Players guide a snake through a 6√ó6 grid of letters to collect three hidden themed words while avoiding distractor words, creating an engaging blend of action and vocabulary skills.

### What Makes This Game Unique

üêç **Stop-and-Wait Innovation**: Unlike traditional snake games, the snake automatically stops at each letter cell, allowing players to strategically plan their next move and think about word formation. This creates a perfect balance between action and puzzle-solving.

üéØ **Intelligent Puzzle Generation**: Advanced algorithm creates solvable puzzles with proper word distribution across four orientations (horizontal left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top), ensuring every game is both challenging and fair.

üé® **Visual Word Formation**: Snake segments change color based on correctness - blue head with direction arrows, green segments for target word letters, red segments for mistakes, providing instant visual feedback on your progress.

üß© **Multi-Directional Word Placement**: Words can be placed in any of four orientations, creating complex puzzle layouts that require spatial thinking and strategic snake navigation.

üì± **Cross-Platform Controls**: Seamlessly supports keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys), touch controls with directional buttons, and swipe gestures for mobile devices.

üé≠ **Rich Theme System**: Five themed categories (Animals, Colors, Food, Sports, Nature) with 100+ carefully curated words, smart difficulty scaling, and conflict-avoidance algorithms to prevent player confusion.

üéÆ **Adaptive Difficulty**: Three difficulty levels that change both gameplay mechanics and visual hints - from word-visible easy mode to hint-free hard mode with faster snake speeds.

üèÜ **Comprehensive Scoring**: Dynamic scoring system with base points, word completion bonuses, time bonuses, and efficiency multipliers based on difficulty level.

## How to Play

### Game Objective
Find and collect all three hidden target words by guiding your snake through the letter grid. Target words share a common theme, while distractor words are designed to mislead you. The challenge is to identify which words belong to the theme and collect them in the correct sequence.

### Complete Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Game Launch & Setup**
- Click the "üêç Start Playing" button on the splash screen to enter full-screen mode
- The game initializes with your snake (blue head with direction arrow) at position (0,0) in the top-left corner
- A 6√ó6 grid appears filled with letters, containing 3 hidden target words and 2+ distractor words
- The interface displays three main sections: word tracker (left), game board (center), and controls (right)

#### 2. **Understanding the Game Interface**

**Left Sidebar - Word Tracker:**
- **Theme Display**: Shows the current theme category (Animals, Colors, Food, Sports, or Nature)
- **Target Word Progress**: Three progress bars showing completion status for each target word
- **Game Statistics**: Real-time tracking of wrong letters, snake length, and completion percentage
- **Difficulty Hints**: Shows words, word blanks, or minimal hints based on your difficulty setting

**Center - Game Board:**
- **6√ó6 Letter Grid**: Interactive grid with letters that light up when part of words
- **Snake Overlay**: Animated snake with color-coded segments positioned over the grid
- **Visual Feedback**: Letters change appearance when collected, words highlight when completed

**Right Sidebar - Game Controls:**
- **Movement Controls**: Touch buttons for mobile or keyboard shortcuts display for desktop
- **Game Actions**: Pause/Resume, Restart, and Settings buttons
- **Settings Modal**: Difficulty selection and theme picker accessible via settings button

#### 3. **Snake Movement & Controls**

**Desktop Controls:**
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move snake up, down, left, right
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume game
- **R Key**: Restart current game
- **Auto-Stop Feature**: Snake automatically stops when reaching any letter cell

**Mobile Controls:**
- **Touch Buttons**: Tap directional arrows (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí) to move snake
- **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe in any direction for quick movement
- **Touch Interface**: All game controls optimized for touch interaction

**Movement Mechanics:**
- Snake moves at configurable speed (2-4 cells per second based on difficulty)
- Direction changes are immediate but snake won't move backwards into itself
- Snake head displays current direction with arrow indicators (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí)

#### 4. **Letter Collection System**

**Automatic Collection Process:**
1. Snake stops automatically when reaching any letter cell
2. Game checks if the letter is the correct next letter for any target word
3. **Correct Letter**: Snake grows with green segment, +10 points, word progress updates
4. **Wrong Letter**: Snake grows with red segment, -5 points, wrong letter counter increases
5. Letter is marked as collected (yellow highlight) and cannot be collected again
6. Press any movement key to continue snake movement

**Word Formation Rules:**
- Letters must be collected in exact sequence from first to last letter
- Words can be oriented in four directions: horizontal (‚Üí‚Üê) or vertical (‚Üë‚Üì)
- Target words can be collected in any order (you don't need to complete them sequentially)
- Each word has a unique path through the grid that must be followed precisely

#### 5. **Scoring & Progression System**

**Point Values:**
- **Correct Letters**: +10 points each
- **Wrong Letters**: -5 points each
- **Target Word Completion**: +50 point bonus
- **Distractor Word Completion**: +25 point bonus (but doesn't count toward victory)

**Victory Conditions:**
- Collect all three target words to win the game
- Distractor words are optional but provide bonus points
- Game ends immediately when all target words are completed

**Final Score Calculation:**
- **Base Score**: Points from letters and word completions
- **Time Bonus**: Faster completion = higher bonus (max 200 points)
- **Efficiency Bonus**: Fewer wrong letters = higher bonus (max 100 points)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: Easy (1.0x), Medium (1.2x), Hard (1.5x)

#### 6. **Difficulty Levels & Game Modes**

**Easy Mode (2 cells/second):**
- Target words are fully visible in the word tracker
- Slower snake movement allows careful planning
- Theme hints provided to help identify target words
- Best for learning game mechanics and word recognition

**Medium Mode (3 cells/second):**
- Shows word blanks with letter counts (e.g., "_ _ _ _" for 4-letter word)
- Moderate snake speed requires balanced strategy
